# My kubernetes configuration

All configuration is written in [dhall](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang), so you need [dhall-json](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell) installed to generate the yaml.

Run
```
stack install dhall-1.19.0 dhall-json-1.2.5 --resolver=nightly-2018-11-12
```
to install everything
